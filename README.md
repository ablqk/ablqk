### About me

While I aim to progress in cloud microservices and writing in the GO language, Iâ€™ve never really left front-end web UI/UX, as it leaves ample room for creativity in small projects that fit into a few long winter evenings.

### About what I do

I use GitHub for my scarce personal projects, because life.

Namely, you will find here some things I made for friends or just for fun:
- [My take on the Advent Of Code 2020](http://github.com/ablqk/adventofcode), using the GO language,
- Various websites whose code I need to cleanup before I dare make them public.
